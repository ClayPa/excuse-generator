    "Your CTA is quieter than a whisper in a library. 💬<br><em>Tip:</em> Make your call-to-action bold, benefit-driven, and impossible to ignore.",
    "You're ranking for 'What is VPN?' but promoting a VPN affiliate link. 🤔<br><em>Tip:</em> Use buyer-intent keywords like 'best VPN for streaming'.",
    "You wrote 2,000 words… and didn’t recommend the product until the last paragraph. 🐢<br><em>Tip:</em> Lead with value, but introduce your affiliate product early.",
    "Your review reads like a Wikipedia page. 📄<br><em>Tip:</em> Add opinions, comparisons, and personal insights to build trust.",

    "Your page takes longer to load than a lazy Sunday. 🐌<br><em>Tip:</em> Compress images, use caching, and test speed on mobile.",
    "Your content is helpful, but where's the urgency? 🕒<br><em>Tip:</em> Add time-sensitive deals, low stock alerts, or limited offers.",
    "You used 'Click here' as your CTA. Yawn. 😴<br><em>Tip:</em> Try: 'Get the 50% Discount' or 'Start Your Free Trial Now'.",

    "Your blog feels like an ad, not a helpful guide. 🚨<br><em>Tip:</em> Teach first, sell second. Trust is the real funnel.",
    "You've got traffic… but zero email opt-ins. 📬<br><em>Tip:</em> Capture emails so you can follow up with affiliate offers later.",
    "You're waiting for SEO alone to do the job. 🙄<br><em>Tip:</em> Try retargeting ads, email marketing, or communities too.",
