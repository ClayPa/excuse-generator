  "The product image could be holding you back. A clean, high-quality visual can make a big difference.",
  "If you're targeting broad keywords, try narrowing it down. Niche keywords often convert better.",
  "Page speed matters more than you think. Compress large images and consider using a CDN.",
  "Your content should guide, not just inform. Add a clear next step to help users take action.",
  "Visitors may not be ready to buy—consider offering a lead magnet to capture emails first.",
  "Affiliate links need visibility. Don’t hide them at the bottom; give them context and presence.",
  "User experience matters. Ensure your site is easy to navigate, especially on mobile.",
  "People need comparison to make decisions. Use charts, pros/cons, or short summaries.",
  "Avoid intrusive pop-ups on mobile. Keep things clean and Google-friendly.",
  "If your CTA blends in, it won’t convert. Use a standout color that draws attention.",
  "Missing trust signals? Try adding product ratings, testimonials, or expert reviews.",
  "Ranking is great—but are you targeting buyers? Focus on high-intent search terms.",
  "Use meaningful link copy. Instead of “click here,” explain what the user gets.",
  "List benefits, not just features. Show how the product improves their situation.",
  "Your tone might be too formal. Write like you're having a real conversation with your reader.",
  "Too many products on one page can be overwhelming. Focus on one strong recommendation.",
  "Avoid long introductions. Get to the product or solution quickly to hold attention.",
  "Affiliate links should have context. Tell users *why* this link helps them.",
  "Value always comes first. Be helpful before being promotional—it builds trust."
